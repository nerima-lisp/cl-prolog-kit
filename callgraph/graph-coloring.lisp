;;;; callgraph/graph-coloring.lisp - FD-constraint graph coloring
;;;;
;;;; Treats direct call edges between two functions as an "interference":
;;;; COLOR-CALL-GRAPH assigns each defined function a color in 1..N such
;;;; that no two functions connected by a direct call share a color, using
;;;; cl-prolog-kit's finite-domain constraint solver (CL-PROLOG-KIT:INS domain
;;;; restriction, pairwise CL-PROLOG-KIT:|#\=| disequality, CL-PROLOG-KIT:LABELING
;;;; search) rather than a hand-rolled greedy-coloring algorithm.
